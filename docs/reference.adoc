[#reference-catch]
==== catch

__Summary__::

The operator `catch` handles errors (completion messages of type `.failure`) from an upstream publisher by replacing the failed publisher with another publisher.
The operator also transforms the Failure type to `<Never>`.

__Constraints on publisher__::

* __none__

__icon:apple[] Documentation reference__::


* https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers/catch[`Publishers.Catch`]

__Usage__::

* <<patterns.adoc#patterns-oneshot-error-handling>> shows an example of using `catch` to handle errors with a one-shot publisher.
* <<patterns.adoc#patterns-continual-error-handling>> shows an example of using `catch` with `flatMap` to handle errors with a continual publisher.

__Details__::

Once catch receives a `.failure` completion, it won't send any further incoming values from the original upstream publisher.
You can also view catch as a switch that only toggles in one direction: to using a new publisher that you define, but only when the original publisher to which it is subscribed sends an error.

This can be illustrated with the following code snippet:

[source, swift]
----
enum testFailureCondition: Error {
    case invalidServerResponse
}

let simplePublisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Error>()

let _ = simplePublisher
    .catch { err in
        // must return a Publisher
        return Publishers.Just("replacement value")
    }
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { fini in
        print(".sink() received the completion:", String(describing: fini))
    }, receiveValue: { stringValue in
        print(".sink() received \(stringValue)")
    })

simplePublisher.send("oneValue")
simplePublisher.send("twoValue")
simplePublisher.send(completion: Subscribers.Completion.failure(testFailureCondition.invalidServerResponse))
simplePublisher.send("redValue")
simplePublisher.send("blueValue")
simplePublisher.send(completion: .finished)
----

In this example, we are using a `PassthroughSubject` so that we can control when and what gets sent from the publisher.
In the above code, we are sending two good values, then a failure, then attempting to send two more good values.
The values you would see printed from our `.sink()` closures are:

[source]
----
.sink() received oneValue
.sink() received twoValue
.sink() received replacement value
.sink() received the completion: finished
----

When the failure was sent through the pipeline, catch intercepts it and returns "replacement value" as expected.
The replacement publisher it used (`Publishers.Just`) sends a single value and then sends a completion.
If we want the pipeline to remain active, we need to change how we handle the errors.
