__Goal__::

* Using Future to turn an an asynchronous call into publisher to use the result in a combine pipeline.

import Contacts
let futureAsyncPublisher = Future<Bool, Error> { promise in <1>
    CNContactStore().requestAccess(for: .contacts) { grantedAccess, err in <2>
        // err is an optional
        if let err = err { <3>
            promise(.failure(err))
        }
        return promise(.success(grantedAccess)) <4>
    }
}.eraseToAnyPublisher()

<1> Future itself has you define the return types and takes a closure.
It hands in a Result object matching the type description, which you interact.
<2> You can invoke the async API however is relevant, including passing in it's required closure.
<3> Within the completion handler, you determine what would cause a failure or a success. A call to `promise(.failure(<FailureType>))` returns the failure.
<4> Or a call to `promise(.success(<OutputType>))` returns a value.
