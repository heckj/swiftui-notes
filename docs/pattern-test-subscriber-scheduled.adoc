[#patterns-testing-subscriber-scheduled]
== Testing a subscriber with scheduled sends from PassthroughSubject

__Goal__::

* For testing a pipeline, or subscriber, when what you want to test is the timing of the pipeline.

__Code and explanation__::

There are a number of operators in Combine that are specific to the timing of data, including <<reference#reference-debounce,debounce>>, <<reference#reference-throttle,throttle>>, and <<reference#reference-delay,delay>>.
You may want to test that your pipeline timing is having the desired impact, independently of doing UI testing.

One way of handling this leverages the both https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation[XCTestExpectation] and a <<reference#reference-passthroughsubject,passthroughSubject>>, combining the two.
Building on both <<patterns#patterns-testing-publisher,Testing a publisher with XCTestExpectation>> and <<patterns#patterns-testing-subscriber,Testing a subscriber with a PassthroughSubject>>, add https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue[DispatchQueue] in the test to schedule invocations of PassthroughSubject's `.send()` method.

An example of this:

.https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/blob/master/UsingCombineTests/PublisherTests.swift#L178[UsingCombineTests/PublisherTests.swift - testKVOPublisher]
[source, swift]
----
func testKVOPublisher() {
    let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: self.debugDescription)
    let foo = KVOAbleNSObject()
    let q = DispatchQueue(label: self.debugDescription) <1>

    let _ = foo.publisher(for: \.intValue)
        .print()
        .sink { someValue in
            print("value of intValue updated to: >>\(someValue)<<")
        }

    q.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5, execute: { <2>
        print("Updating to foo.intValue on background queue")
        foo.intValue = 5
        expectation.fulfill() <3>
    })
    wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 5.0) <4>
}
----

<1> This adds a `DispatchQueue` to your test, naming the queue after the test itself.
This really only shows when debugging test failures, and is convenient as a reminder of what is happening in the test code vs. any other background queues that might be in use.
<2> `.asyncAfter` is used along with the deadline parameter to define when a call gets made.
<3> The simplest form embeds any relevant assertions into the subscriber or around the subscriber. Additionally, invoking the `.fulfill()` on your expectation as the last queued entry you send lets the test know that it is now complete.
<4> Make sure that when you set up the wait that allow for sufficient time for your queue'd calls to be invoked.

A definite downside to this technique is that it forces the test to take a minimum amount of time matching the maximum queue delay in the test.

Another option is a 3rd party library named EntwineTest, which was inspired by the RxTest library.
EntwineTest is part of Entwine, a Swift library that expands on Combine with some helpers.
The library can be found on Github at https://github.com/tcldr/Entwine.git, available under the MIT license.

One of the key elements included in EntwineTest is a virtual time scheduler, as well as additional classes that schedule (`TestablePublisher`) and collect and record (`TestableSubscriber`) the timing of results while using this scheduler.

An example of this from the EntwineTest project README is included:

.https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/blob/master/UsingCombineTests/EntwineTestExampleTests.swift[UsingCombineTests/EntwineTestExampleTests.swift - testExampleUsingVirtualTimeScheduler]
[source, swift]
----
func testExampleUsingVirtualTimeScheduler() {
    let scheduler = TestScheduler(initialClock: 0) <1>
    var didSink = false
    let cancellable = Just(1) <2>
        .delay(for: 1, scheduler: scheduler)
        .sink { _ in
            didSink = true
        }

    XCTAssertNotNil(cancellable)
    // where a real scheduler would have triggered when .sink() was invoked
    // the virtual time scheduler requires resume() to commence and runs to
    // completion.
    scheduler.resume() <3>
    XCTAssertTrue(didSink) <4>
}
----

<1> Using the virtual time scheduler requires you create one at the start of the test, initializing its clock to a starting value.
The virtual time scheduler in EntwineTest will commence subscription at the value `200` and times out at `900` if the pipeline isn't complete by that time.
<2> You create your pipeline, along with any publishers or subscribers, as normal.
EntwineTest also offers a testable publisher and a testable subscriber that could be used as well.
For more details on these parts of EntwineTest, see <<patterns#patterns-testable-publisher-subscriber,Using EntwineTest to create a testable publisher and subscriber>>.
<3> `.resume()` needs to be invoked on the virtual time scheduler to commence its operation and run the pipeline.
<4> Assert against expected end results after the pipeline has run to completion.
