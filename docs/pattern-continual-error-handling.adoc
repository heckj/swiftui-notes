== Using flatMap with catch to handle errors

__Goal__::

* The `flatMap` operator can be used with `catch` to continue to handle errors on new published values.

__Code and explanation__::

The `flatMap` operator is the operator to use in handling errors on a continual flow of events.

You provide a closure to flatMap that can read in the value that was provided, and creates a one-shot closure that does the possibly failing work.
An example of this is requesting data from a network and then decoding the returned data.
You can include a <<reference#reference-catch,catch>> operator to capture any errors and provide any appropriate value.

This is a perfect mechanism for when you want to maintain updates up an upstream publisher, as it creates one-shot publisher or short pipelines that send a single value and then complete for every incoming value.
The completion from the created one-shot publishers terminates in the flatMap and isn't passed to downstream subscribers.

An example of this with a dataTaskPublisher:

[source, swift]
----
let remoteDataPublisher = Just(self.testURL!) <1>
    .flatMap { url in <2>
        URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url) <3>
        .tryMap { data, response -> Data in <4>
            guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
                httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else {
                    throw TestFailureCondition.invalidServerResponse
            }
            return data
        }
        .decode(type: PostmanEchoTimeStampCheckResponse.self, decoder: JSONDecoder()) <5>
        .catch {_ in <6>
            return Just(PostmanEchoTimeStampCheckResponse(valid: false))
        }
    }
    .subscribe(on: self.myBackgroundQueue!)
    .eraseToAnyPublisher()
----

<1> Just starts this publisher as an example by passing in a URL.
<2> flatMap takes the URL as input and the closure goes on to create a one-shot publisher chain.
<3> dataTaskPublisher uses the input url
<4> which flows to tryMap to parse for additional errors
<5> and finally decode to attempt to refine the returned data into a local type
<6> if any of these have failed, catch will convert the error into a placeholder sample, in this case an object with a preset `valid = false` property.
