= About This Book

This is an intermediate to advanced book, focusing on how to use a specific framework (Combine) provided by Apple.
The work is written with an expectation of a solid understanding of the Swift programming language, including reference and value types, protocols, and comfort with the existing Foundation framework.

This work provides <<introduction#introduction,a very abbreviated introduction>> to the concept of functional reactive programming, which is what this library is meant to provide.
