This is an intermediate to advanced book, focusing narrowly on how to use the Combine framework.
The writing and examples expect that you have a solid understanding of Swift including reference and value types, protocols, and familiarity with using common elements from the Foundation framework.

If you are starting with Swift, https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/[Apple provides a number of resources] to learn it.
There are truly amazing tutorials and introductions available as books from a number of authors, including https://gumroad.com/l/swift-kickstart[A Swift Kickstart] by Daniel Steinberg and https://www.hackingwithswift.com[Hacking with Swift] by Paul Hudson.

This book provides <<introduction#introduction,a very abbreviated introduction>> to the concept of functional reactive programming, which is what Combine is meant to provide.
