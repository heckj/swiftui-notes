= About This Book

This is an intermediate to advanced book, focusing fairly narrowly on how to use the Combine framework provided by Apple.
The writing and examples expect that you have a solid understanding of Swift including reference and value types, protocols, and comfort with using common elements from the Foundation framework.

If you are also just starting with Swift, https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/[Apple provides a number of resources] to learn it, and there are truly amazing tutorials and introductions available in book form a number of authors, including https://gumroad.com/l/swift-kickstart[A Swift Kickstart] by Daniel Steinberg and https://www.hackingwithswift.com[Hacking with Swift] by Paul Hudson.

This book provides <<introduction#introduction,a very abbreviated introduction>> to the concept of functional reactive programming, which is what this library is meant to provide.
